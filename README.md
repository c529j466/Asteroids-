# Asteroids-
Remake of the Atari game, Asteroids

## Description

For this project, I used resources online to recreate the Atari game, Asteroids, using only JavaScript. This remake uses the canvas element of HTML, multiple trigonometry principles, and local storage to store high scores. The page functions in that a user visits the deployed page and is able to instantly play Asteroids. Users are also able to track their high scores and start new games when they lose all of their lives. My motivation for completing this project was to better understand game development, how JavaScript can be used for gaming principles, and to further my knowledge of programming. 

## Installation

To play this remake of Asteroids, visit the deployed applicaiton link or clone the repository to your local system.
